# Mr.-Jack-Plus-Version-
Final Project
Whitechapel, 1888. Despite the police’s best efforts, Jack is still on the loose. The famous Sherlock Holmes is tasked with 
ending the crime spree of this maniac. But Jack has a few tricks up his sleeves and disguised himself as one of the detectives 
on the crime scene! It is up to Sherlock to unmask the madman; but he must hurry, or Jack will vanish into the night…

HOW TO PLAY: Each player endorses one role: Sherlock or Jack. Sherlock's goal is to clear every other investigator until
there is only one left: the one Jack is impersonating. In order to achieve this, he will need to have line of sight over his 
fellow detectives; each night Jack will have to tell if he is currently visible or not, allowing Sherlock to eliminate suspects. 
On the opposing side, Jack's goal is only to delay the investigation until dawn, when he can escape. Each night, both players
will be able to reshape the board in order to shed a dim light on the streets of the city, or to remain hidden in the shadows...

What is new:
